# Stan Workshop for BES conference in December 2017

## Required packages

To make the most of the coding session please come to the workshop with the following packages installed:

* rstan (v2.16 or higher)
* bayesplot (v1.4 or higher)
* brms (v1.10 or higher)
* ggplot2
* reshape2
* plyr
* MASS

## Structure of the workshop

* 30min general introduction into Bayesian data analysis, 15min Lionel, 15min Maxime
* 30min interactive fitting of models using brms (or rstanarm?), using shinystan for checking model fitness, learn about convergence issues, fit models of increasing complexity:
..1. Linear model 
..2. Generalized Linear Model (Negative Binomial)
..3. Mixed-effect models, varying intercept, varying intercept and slopes, crossed and nested random effects
..4. Zero-inflated overdispersed poisson model
* Provide tools to interprete the models and draw inference from them (credible intervals, posterior predictive checks, LOOIC ...)
* 30min small group sessions where participants using similar datasets/models exchange on how they could take the bayesian leaps and what issues they might face

## Structure of the repository

One folder for each part of the workshop (introduction, model\_fitting, small\_groups). 

## Timeline

* First version of the presentation and coding script uploaded on the 27th of October

* Test session by Lionel in Gent on the 21st of November.
